# ITFrame

ITFrame stands for Innovate Technologies Framework
and started back in March 2014 as a fast Centova Cast backend used by our current services.

ITFrame was the first piece of software written in Node.js inside Innovate Technologies.
We chose Node.js for its extendability and asynchronious character.

The original ITFrame code has seen many transitions over time and became too complicated.
That is why we have totally refactored the software. We'll probably also release a lite version soon that only contains the routes to manage Cast servers.
